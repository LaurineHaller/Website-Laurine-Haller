  <p>DER KONFLIKT– ÜBER ORANGE, REGELN IM ALLTAG UND MACHTMISSBRAUCH, 2019 <br/>
         <m>Conflic</m> is the topic of my prediploma project that discusses regulations and norms in architecture. Triggered by own confrontations with such. 
In my project work I raise questions such as how people come to their decisions and how guidelines shape our environment. I also explore questions of social values and the norm in general with my magazine.
Starting with a case study in Stuttgart, my home town, the project revolves around an orange house in Alte Dorfstraße 45/45A in Stuttgart-Birkach.
An interview shows two points of view, that of the citizen and that of the monument conservationist.
Factors of overriding influence are attached to the interviewee with their own observations on society, the law, existing differences and expected 
future perspectives. They are supplemented by global examples on a larger scale in order to open up the view to the outside world. <br/>
With my project I take the position of an observer or walker, which shows the position of the country, the city or the monument conservationist towards a citizen. The conservationist, the conservative slow element, stands for preserving history while the citizen, the progressive fast element, stands for 
progress. <br/>
My project shows criticism from both sides. <br/>
One of of the regulatory policies and economic forces that define, limit and control our freedom as citizens; and the other, a critique of our society that far too seldom ventures out of our comfortable space to take new risks.
